**Colour space viewer** visualises different colour space cubes in 3 projections.


Colour space viewer is a tiny program which just visualises different colour spaces.
Some people have difficulties with understanding what colourspaces are and what their components really mean. This program shows three dissections of colourcubes and allows a user to move these dissections.


It can show the common colour spaces:
  * RGB
  * HSL
  * HSV
as well as some less common
  * YCbCr
  * HCY (Hue/Chroma/Luma).


YCbCr and HCY feature equal luminosity since they have Luma ( Y ) component, which is why they are closer to human perception. YCbCr and similar colourspaces (YPbPr, YUV) are used in television, JPEGs etc.
HCY is a colourspace which shares some features with HSL and YCbCr - it has Luma ( Y ) like YCbCr and fills the whole cube space like HSL, making it an ideal candidate for image editing.
